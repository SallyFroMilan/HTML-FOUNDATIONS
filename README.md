### Basics of HTML & CSS
<strong>HTML and CSS</strong> are two of the <em>foundational building blocks</em> of pretty much <strong>everything on the web.</strong>
<p><strong>HTML</strong> works together <strong>CSS</strong>, two <em>languages</em> that <em>create everything you see</em> when you look at something on the <strong>Internet.</strong></p>
<strong>HTML</strong> provides <strong>structure and meaning</strong> to our <em>text</em>: it creates all the <em>text, links, cards, lists, and buttons</em>.<br>
<strong>CSS</strong> is what adds <strong>style</strong> to those <em>plain elements.</em></p>
<p><strong>HTML</strong> puts <strong>information on a webpage</strong>.<br>
<strong>CSS</strong> positions that <strong>information</strong>, gives it <strong>color</strong>, changes the <strong>font</strong>, and makes it <strong>look great!</strong>
